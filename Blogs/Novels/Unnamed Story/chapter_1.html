                <main class="fs-custom novel-context">
                    <p>I have been reading a lot of romance lightnovels until now. In this genre, you can easily come across a romance story
                    that start as a childhood friend relationship. But to be clear, not only in lightnovel, you might already hear a lot of stories about it in real life. </p>
                    <p>When we were kids, making friends was simple, we didn't care about any complicated details.
                    If we somehow found it comfortable, or just simply fun, to talk with someone, then somewhere in our hearts, they had already become our friend. Compared to how we make friends now, it was much simpler.
                    As we grow up, we experience more and more things in life. Therefore, when talking about starting a new relationship, we have to consider a lot of things. We tend to think about the 
                    advantages and disadvantages that this new relationship might bring. By the time we relize it, our relationships have already become a relationship of convenience.</p>
                    <p>Maybe that's what makes love stories of childhood friends so pure and beautiful. Two people - come to each other by the help of the string of destiny, begin as a friend, without any hidden motives.
                    As they grow up, they slowly start to consider more about the other. And when that time come, one of them relize their romantic feelings for the other. This is when the story starting to be complicating and more interesting.
                    After a bunch of events, usually there's are only two endings. The happy one is they successfully become a couple and start feeding you a lot of sugar. 
                    And the other ending is the bad one, where they never become a couple, meaning their friendship is also ruined or they will stay at that friendship forever.</p>
                    <p>Now, I'll tell you about my own story, which is also a childhood friend story.</p>
                    <p>I've born in a small family. Originally, I was born in Saigon - which is Ho Chi Minh City now. 
                    But before long, my dad's company transferred him to the Dong Nai branch, so he decided to bring the whole family with him. I've lived in that place for about 8 years before I moved back to Saigon, so you can say most of my childhood time was there. 
                    But to be honest, I don't want to remember that old time, the reason why I've moved back after 8 years living there is because <b>family violence</b>. My dad cheated on my mom and he didn't even try to admit it even though the evidences are very clear, 
                    he used to beat my mom several times before, and there was even a time he said he want to take her life. At that time, I was very shocked as a kid, I have heard a lot of things about family violence but never once
                    thought that I would be in that situation one day. After that, my mom and dad separated in practice, but not legally. Since our family is Catholic, once you're married, there's no way to break the marriage contract.
                    Until now, I'm still haunted by those memories. There was even a time I can't stop myself from thinking that I'll never try to get married in future because I don't want to be someone like my dad. 
                    Therefore, I was slowly starting to be afraid of making friends with girls.</p>
