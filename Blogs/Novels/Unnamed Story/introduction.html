                   <p>Hi! Welcome to my very very first novel :D! </p>
                   <p>First of all, the main reason I'm writing this novel is
                    to improve my English writing skills (I kinda suck at English even though I'm studying in APCS LOL).</p>
                   <p>The context of this novel is simply about lighthearted youthful love, and it's <u>based on my true story</u>, but please notice that some parts in this novel is <u>not true</u> compare to the actual story because it was based on my own memories, my own thinking and my experiences. I also changed the real names of the characters to fictional ones.</p>
                   <p>After reading these lines, you might already relize that improving my English isn't my real purpose LOL. Well I admit that I just want a place to keep my stories - my precious memories. Because, you know, we humans tend to forget things, even if we still remember them, they never feel quite the same as when we actually experienced them.</p>
                   <p>Last thing, since this novel is based on my real story - which is still ongoing as I'm writing this - you can think of it as a diary. I'll try my best to update it weekly (hopefully). </p>
                   <p>Okay that's all, let's start our first chapter of this novel, hope you enjoy reading my novel! (Feel free to send me feedback via DM my social media btw!).
                   </p>

                   <p>* If you're <span style="color: red;">that person</span>, congratulation in successfully found out this website, I hope you're still doing well ðŸŒ².</p>
