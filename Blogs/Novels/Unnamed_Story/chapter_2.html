                <main class="fs-custom novel-context">
                    <p>As time flowed, the messages between us became fewer and farther apart. By the time I was in 8th grade, I've already quitted drawing, 
                    my love for Thỏ Bảy Màu also slowly getting fainted. Since my mom always want me to get higher and higher grades, I spent most of the time to study.
                    In this time, I've found my new interest in programming. Thus, I started focus more on programming and studying. And you know, our humans, when we're too focus on doing something,
                    we simply don't care about anything else. Even after we finish our work, exhaustion quietly creeps in, making us want to do nothing but rest.</p>
                    <p>To me, that side of human nature is what I resent the most. The more exhausted we become, the less we seem to care about the world around us.
                    This is the main reason why at the moment we step into the world of adults, endless rush and busyness of work and life, mercilessly taking over all the hours we have. 
                    As a result, our old relationships now become somewhat less important to us. <i>(Well I use this as an example for my story but writing those lines at the age of 18 make me feel old already LOL)</i></p>
                    <p>The same thing happened with me, my last message with Nhi was around the end of the first semester of 8th grade. After that, it feels like we've already forgotten each other. 
                    But maybe I was just the only who forget about her existance. </p>
                    <p>Not so long before I became a 9th grader, meaning I'm going take a highschool entrance exam next year. 
                    If you don't know, my old self used to hate doing math pretty much. Well I was born with a "slow CPU", it's not like I can do anything about it. 
                    But I've changed my mind after I got to know more about Competitive Programming (CP). I found it fun to see how we can apply math in solving a problem. 
                    After I tried to give it a try, I've got myself a third prize in a programming contest in my city (HSGTP 9). Because I have had motivation to go further in CP, I deciced to apply for Informatics Gifted Class in Gia Dinh High School.</p>
                    <p>In the blink of an eye, the highschool entrance exam is going to be hold in the next few weeks. One day, after studying for hours, I was mindlessly browsing my computer. While checking my old email, I've found Nhi's email. If I was remember 
                    correctly, there was a time we've exchanged our email address, and sent a first email to say hi. But at the time I checked that email, there were no messages in there, maybe it has been corrupted. Fortunately, Nhi's email was still there so everything was fine.
                    Since I was boring, I tried to send Nhi an email thinking that there's no way she will respond. And yes, she replied to that email!</p>
                    <p>After chatting for a while, I've got to know that Nhi also apply for the same highschool with me. Even now, I'm still surprised by how coincidental it was.</p>
                    <p>In the end, both I and Nhi passed the entrance exam, successfully got in the same highschool together.</p>
                    <p>We did a small meetup at the school entrance day. My first impression after seeing Nhi for the first time after years was that, she looked very mature. Not like me, still a retarded until now. She had a neat shoulder-length lob that framed her face softly, along with that bright signature smile
                    that hasn't changed at all. She also wore glasses, which was the biggest difference between her elementary and highschool appearance. All of those things gave her a subtle, gentle charm - the kind that made you feel at ease without even knowing why.</p>
                    <p>So we have some friendly talks, you know, kind of talk people usually do when they meet their old friend. And that was, the longest talk we did in our highschool time.</p>
                    <p>...</p>
                    <p>Yep I know you're thinking why is this shit so bullshit but this is the truth. And the reason is still the same reason as my middle school time, I spent all of my time in CP, Nhi also spent her time in geography. Plus, we were in a different class so even if we want to talk, there were no common things betwwen us to start with. But maybe I was just trying to cover up my cowardice.</p>
                    <p>Honestly speaking, I feel like Nhi has became another person, the only thing that made her the same person as that old time was her signature smile. I didn't mean it in the bad way, but I just feel like we're in a different world now. It made me think that, our current friendship is connecting by an edge labeled: "Old friend".  
                    Nhi's my only precious friend. She's someone who is really important to me. And the fact that, without that labeled edge, we're nothing to the other, hurts me so deeply. You might think why don't I just start to talk and make friend again with her. That sounds easy.</p>
                    <p><i>But I don't have the courage to talk to her.</i></p>
                    <p>Because I'm afraid, I'm afraid that if I try to talk to her, then one day, not so long, my broken personality will hurt her and ruin our friendship forever. I've lost so many important things in my life, and I can't bear the thought of losing her too. </p>
