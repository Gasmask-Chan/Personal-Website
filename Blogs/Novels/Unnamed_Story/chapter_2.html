                    <p>As time flowed, the messages between us became fewer and farther apart. By the time I was in 8th grade, I've already quitted drawing, 
                    my love for Thỏ Bảy Màu also slowly getting fainted. Since my mom always want me to get higher and higher grades, I spent most of the time to study.
                    In this time, I've found my new interest in programming. Thus, I started focus more on programming and studying. And you know, our humans, when we're too focus on doing something,
                    we simply don't care about anything else. Even after we finish our work, exhaustion quietly creeps in, making us want to do nothing but rest.</p>
                    <p>To me, that side of human nature is what I resent the most. The more exhausted we become, the less we seem to care about the world around us.
                    This is the main reason why at the moment we step into the world of adults, endless rush and busyness of work and life, mercilessly taking over all the hours we have. 
                    As a result, our old relationships now become somewhat less important to us. (Well I use this as an example for my story but writing those lines at the age of 18 make me feel old already, LOL)</p>
                    <p>The same thing happened with me, my last message with Nhi was around the end of the first semester of 8th grade. After that, it feels like we've already forgotten each other. 
                    But maybe I was just the only who forget about her existance. </p>
                    <p>Not so long before I became a 9th grader, meaning I'm going take a highschool entrance exam next year. 
                    If you don't know, my old self used to hate doing math pretty much. Well I was born with a slow CPU, it's not like I can do anything about it. 
                    But I've changed my mind after I got to know more about Competitive Programming. I found it fun to see how we can apply math in solving problem. 
                    I've got a small prize from a programming contest from my city (HSGTP 9).</p>
